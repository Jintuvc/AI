Agentic RAG Chatbot using MCP

A modular, agent-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that allows users to upload documents (PDFs, DOCX, PPTX, CSVs, etc.) and ask questions grounded in the uploaded content. The system uses custom agents, vector search (FAISS), and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 via LangChain to generate accurate and context-aware responses.
